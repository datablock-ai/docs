The Investor Portal is the dashboard investors use to get a full overview of their investments through Spring.

The Investor Portal allows you to:

- View and trade all OTC-enabled deals on the **Trading** page.
- View deals that are fundraising and have a public pool. These can be viewed from the **Fundraising** page.
- View the past projects the platform has raised funds for in the **Past Project** section on the Fundraising page.
- View and manage all past investments they have made through the **Portfolio** page.
- You can set and change the default information used when investing, such as wallets, contact information, social handles, and email, in your **Settings**.
