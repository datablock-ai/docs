## How can you use the different allocation management features?

1. **Overview** — Quickly view and update the receiving wallet for investors. Additionally, you can track all events related to the specific wallet and deal

2. **Transfer** — Easily transfer an allocation to a new wallet. If an investor's wallet has been compromised or hacked, it is imperative that you move all the investor's allocations to a new account

3. **Adjust allocation** — Adjust the wallet allocation. You can add and subtract allocations from the investor's wallet.

4. **Change pool** — Enables you to move an investor to a different pool. This is useful if you prefer to place the investor in a pool other than the one they originally contributed to.

5. **Form info** — View the questions and consents provided by investors when they invested in the deal.
