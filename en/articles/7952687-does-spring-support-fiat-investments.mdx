Spring doesn't offer direct FIAT on-ramp functionality. However, the platform allows you to document and track allocations completed through traditional currency without requiring an on-chain transaction.

<Note>
While you still have to receive the FIAT outside Spring, the investment can be managed inside Spring like any other allocation.

## FIAT Investment Process

The platform uses the Spring importer tool to add FIAT-based investments to your fundraising records. This tool assists in uploading investor contact details and contribution amounts made via traditional currency into the allocation management system.

For detailed import procedures, see [How to import past deals into Spring](/en/articles/6998840-how-to-import-past-deals-into-spring).

## Investor Benefits

Investors contributing through FIAT receive token allocations according to the established vesting schedule, matching the treatment of other contributors. Their investment details become visible in the investor portal, providing the same visibility as blockchain-based investments.
