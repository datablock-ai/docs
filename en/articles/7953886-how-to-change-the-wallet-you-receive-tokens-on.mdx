## Key Information

There are two methods for updating your token receipt wallet:

1. **Self-Service:** You can independently modify the wallet address, provided the platform owner has enabled editing permissions for that specific deal.

2. **Administrator Assistance:** A platform administrator can make the change on your behalf.

## Important Distinctions

### Account Wallet vs. Receiving Wallet

<Warning>
Changing the receiving wallet does **not** change your account wallet.
</Warning>

Your allocation remains visible in the investor portal linked to your login credentials, not your new receiving wallet.

### Moving Allocations Between Accounts

To transfer your allocation to a different account for visibility in another investor portal, you must request assistance from a platform administrator—this cannot be done independently.
