## Current Support

Spring enables users to add a Multi-sig wallet address as the fundraising wallet.

## Current Limitations

The platform does not yet support:
- Logging in using a multi-sig wallet
- Contributing through a multi-sig wallet

## Workaround

Despite these restrictions, there's an alternative pathway: an investor can still contribute directly to your contribution wallet using a multi-sig wallet. Users can subsequently add the transaction hash to allocation management after the contribution is made. This requires manual addition of the investor to the allocation management system.

<Note>
The team plans to expand multi-sig support in the future.
