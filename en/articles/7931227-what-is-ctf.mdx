CTF, or Counter-Terrorism Financing, refers to measures taken to prevent the funding of terrorist activities. Terrorist financing involves providing financial support or resources, directly or indirectly, to individuals, groups, or organizations involved in terrorism.

<Warning>
Investment groups without CTF measures in place are at risk of enabling fund transactions that ultimately lead to terrorism and pose risks to global security.
