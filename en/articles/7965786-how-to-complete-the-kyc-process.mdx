<Warning>
Include your full name with correct spelling to avoid errors or delays. The name you write in the 'About you' field must match exactly the one in your ID.
</Warning>

## ID Upload Requirements

### Checklist for Valid ID:
- Not expired
- Contains date of birth
- Clear and legible presentation
- Free from light reflection

<Tip>
Uploading your passport will speed up the KYC process. Uploading other types of ID may prolong the KYC process.
</Tip>

Available ID types depend on country selection. For certain jurisdictions, only passports are accepted. See [Accepted IDs for KYC](/en/articles/8736254-accepted-ids-for-kyc) for an overview of passport-only requirements.

<Warning>
Providing false information or an inauthentic ID (fake ID, modified ID, or someone else's ID) will ban you from registration and investment.
</Warning>

## Selfie Requirements

The selfie must clearly display the face from front, left, and right angles:
- Position face center, then move left and right
- Remove obstacles (glasses, etc.)
- Ensure adequate lighting
- Maintain clarity (no blur)

## KYC Status Explanations

**"KYC is pending"** indicates incomplete or incorrect verification. Contact: compliance@spring.net with your wallet address.

**"Needs review"** means compliance analysis is underway. Do not resubmit, as this delays processing.
