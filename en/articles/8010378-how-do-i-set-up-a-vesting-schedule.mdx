## What This Feature Allows You to Do

- Create vesting schedules for deals from start to end
- Show a breakdown of all batches (distributions) ahead of time
- Get an overview of all upcoming distributions in the Vesting tab

## How to Set Up the Vesting Schedule

1. Navigate to your desired deal
2. Access the Distributions tab and select "Create schedule"
3. Enter required fields: TGE %, TGE date, number of batches (excluding TGE), first batch date, and batch interval
4. Click "Save vesting schedule"
5. Use "Edit schedule" for future modifications

## Creating Schedules with External Allocations

When you are going to distribute from existing allocations and vesting schedules originating outside of Spring, you need to import these allocations first.

Contact the Customer Success team via Telegram for assistance.

## When Dates Are Undetermined

Distribution breakdowns can be generated without finalized dates, allowing schedule configuration later.

## Multiple Vesting Schedules

<Note>
A deal can only represent one vesting schedule at a time. You can create unlimited vesting schedules with unlimited deals.
