## What is Spring's OTC Trading?

Our OTC Trading allows investors to list, buy, and sell their off-chain allocations in a secondary marketplace inside your platform.

Participants can transact allocations before token launch (Pre-TGE) or after vesting commences (Post-TGE).

## Benefits

- Purchase and liquidate locked allocations immediately
- Create buy/sell orders to acquire additional allocations or achieve liquidity

## Activation Steps

1. Navigate to the **OTC** tab
2. Define your **EVM Escrow Wallet** and **Escrow Fee**
3. Go to the **Deals** tab
4. Select the desired **Deal**
5. Toggle the OTC button to activate trading

<Note>
For an allocation to be eligible for sale, OTC trading must be activated by the platform admin for the respective deal.
</Note>

## Fee Structure

Two fee components apply to transactions:

- **Escrow Fee:** Platform manager-determined charge
- **Service Fee:** A 2.5% fee by Spring on all OTC trades

Fees add to the purchase amount. Example: A $1,000 transaction incurs additional fees charged to the buyer.
