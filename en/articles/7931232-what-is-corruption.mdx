Corruption is when people in power misuse their position for personal gain. It can involve bribery, fraud, or abusing their authority. Corruption is harmful because it leads to unfairness, inequality, and a lack of trust in institutions.

Preventing and addressing corruption remains essential for maintaining societal fairness and accountability.
