## What You Are Able to Do on the OTC Marketplace

The platform enables two primary functions:
- Buy and sell your locked allocations instantly.
- List buy and sell orders to get more allocations or get liquid.

<Note>
For an allocation to be eligible for sale, OTC trading must be activated by the platform admin for the respective deal.
</Note>

## The OTC Fee

There is a fee associated with each trade. This fee is charged to the buyer of the allocation.

The complete fee consists of:

1. **Escrow Fee:** A fee that is freely chosen by the manager of a platform.
2. **Service Fee:** A 2.5% fee by Spring on all OTC trades.

## How Is the Fee Added?

The fee is added to the total sum of the buy order. This means that if a buyer wants to complete a $1000 OTC trade, the buyer will have to pay $1000 + service fee to complete the purchase.
