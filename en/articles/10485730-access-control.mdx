## Overview

The Access Control system enables platform administrators to manage how investors gain access to their platforms, providing customizable access criteria that align with syndicate requirements.

## Access Control Panel

Administrators can configure three independent settings:

1. **Open/Closed Access** – Determines whether new investors can submit applications to the platform. Additional options only apply when the platform is open.

2. **Basic/Tier Requirements** – Specifies whether investors must meet certain tier qualifications before applying. Admins define which tiers trigger Access Control verification.

3. **Automatic/Manual Approvals** – Determines if investors receive instant acceptance or require administrator review after requesting access.

## Welcome Message Customization

Admins can add a rich-text welcome message for investors that displays in:
- Welcome emails sent to approved investors
- A modal window upon first visit after approval

## Tier Checking for Investors

Investors applying to platforms with tier requirements can:
- View the tier requirements directly in the application flow
- Check their current qualification status based on holdings
- Request an immediate eligibility check to reflect recent token acquisitions
