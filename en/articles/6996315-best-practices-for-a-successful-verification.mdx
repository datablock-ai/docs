   - Must not be expired

2. **Device with Camera**
   - Mobile devices are preferred for superior photo quality compared to webcams

## What You'll Be Asked to Do

The verification process involves three steps:

1. Specify your country of citizenship and residency
2. Provide a valid government-issued photo ID
3. Take a selfie

### Photography Guidelines

- Ensure images are clear, well-lit (not too dark or bright), and free from glare
- Keep your ID fully visible; lay it flat for photos
- Remove sunglasses, masks, and accessories from your face
- Avoid overhead lighting that creates shadows
- Don't position yourself directly in front of bright light sources
