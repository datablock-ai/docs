Every deal created in Spring's admin portal receives a status designation. Understanding these statuses helps you track your fundraising progress from inception through completion.

## Status Reference Table

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Preparing** | Every new deal starts in the preparing state. It means that the deal is not yet published and requires additional information before launching. |
| **Scheduled** | A deal has been set to launch at a predetermined time. |
| **Fundraising** | The deal is live and investable. Investors can now go to the contribution page and invest. |
| **Closed** | Fundraising has ended; investors cannot contribute further. Token distributions may now commence. |
| **Distributing** | You've made your first distribution. |
| **Completed** | You've made the final distribution. |
| **Refunded** | All investors were refunded. |
| **Archived** | Used when no other status applies. Notably, investors no longer see the 'archived' state and instead view the deal's previous active status. |
| **OTC Enabled** | Over-the-counter trading is activated but the fundraiser remains open. |
| **OTC Active** | The deal is tradable and investors can see the deal in the 'Trading' section. |
