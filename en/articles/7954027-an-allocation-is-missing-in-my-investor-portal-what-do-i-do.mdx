If you do not see a specific allocation in your investor portal, you should:

1. Check if you made contributions using different accounts.
2. Then, try signing into the specific account associated with that particular allocation.

The data displayed in the investor portal is tied to the account to which the allocation is linked.

To unify all investments into one single portal:

Transfer all allocations to a single account through the admin dashboard. Changing investor accounts can only be done by platform administrators. Please contact your platform's admin to do this.
