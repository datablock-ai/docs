title: "A wallet I have contributed with has been hacked. What do I do?"
description: "In the scenario that your wallet has been compromised, it is paramount that you contact your platform administrator immediately."

<Warning>
If a wallet has been compromised please contact your platform's administrator immediately.
</Warning>

The platform administrators will facilitate transferring allocations to a new account wallet within Spring. This transfer process represents the essential safeguard against unauthorized modifications.

A critical security concern: a hacker who has obtained access to an investor's wallet can sign into the investor's portal using their account and manipulate sensitive data.

**Important limitation:** Simply changing receiving wallet addresses provides incomplete protection. Hackers retaining account access could still alter receiving wallets for open investments.

<Note>
You should always verify with your platform admin that all your allocations have been safely moved to the new account of your choice.
