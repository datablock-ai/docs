title: "An investor is unable to view an allocation in their investor portal. How should I proceed?"
description: "Allocations in the investor portal are displayed based on account wallets. By logging in to the correct account, you'll see your allocation."

## Problem Overview

The core issue is that allocations display according to the wallet associated with each account. Users must access the proper account to view their specific allocation.

## Recommended Steps for Investors

Investors unable to locate an allocation should:

1. Confirm if they made contributions using different accounts.
2. Then, try signing into the specific account associated with that particular allocation.

<Note>
The data displayed in the investor portal is tied to the account to which the allocation is linked.

## Solution for Consolidating Multiple Investments

To combine all investments into a single dashboard:

1. Transfer all allocations to a single account through the admin dashboard.
2. Changing investor accounts can only be done by platform administrators.
