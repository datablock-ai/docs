### To set up your fundraise

1. **Create a deal:** Navigate to **Deals** in your Admin panel and click **New deal**.

2. **Add deal info:** Add key details about the deal and customize specific details like vesting summary and investment target.

3. **Add pool(s):** You'll need to create at least one pool before you fundraise. Pools control who gets access to your deal, and on what terms. Go to **Fundraising > Pools**.

4. **Start fundraising:** Once you click **Start Fundraise**, you can share the investment link so your investors can start investing in the deal.
   - You can start immediately or schedule a future raise.
   - To share with investors: copy the pool link to share.
   - Fundraising can be paused and resumed at any time.

## What is a pool?

Pools determine who gets access to your deal, and on what terms.

### Pool Types

- **Private Pool:** Share a unique link with investors. Only link recipients can access and invest.

- **All Members Pool:** Makes the deal visible to everyone on your platform, appearing on the Fundraising page.

- **Whitelist Pool:** Manually add wallet addresses with specific maximum and minimum contribution limits per wallet.

- **Tier-based pools:** Create pools based on criteria like token holdings, NFTs, or user levels.

### Pool Management

- **Open to Contributions:** Toggle controls when pools become available for investment during fundraising.

- **Pool Cap:** Sets the maximum contribution limit; the pool automatically closes once reached.

<Tip>
Create different pools within one deal with unique rulesets for different investor tiers or groups. Pools can be edited during fundraising.
