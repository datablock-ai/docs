## How to refund: Step-by-step guide

1. Click on the deal requiring the refund
2. Navigate to the fundraising tab
3. Select investor(s) using checkboxes on the left
4. Click the blue refund button
5. Choose the amount or percentage to refund, click next, and choose the chain and currency
6. Click the blue Proceed to Payment button. Ensure that you set the spending cap to default in your wallet
7. Click Pay and confirm in your wallet
8. The refund is now completed. You can view the TX hash at the bottom of the modal
9. The investor gets an email notification, and their allocation is updated automatically

## Which wallet will the investors receive the refunds on?

When refunding through Spring, we select the wallet the investor used as their EVM-receiving wallet while making the investment.

<Note>
The refund will not necessarily be sent to the wallet the investor invested from.
