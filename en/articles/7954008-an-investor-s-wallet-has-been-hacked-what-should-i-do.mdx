title: "An investor's wallet has been hacked. What should I do?"
description: "In the scenario that a wallet has been compromised, it is paramount that you move the investor's allocations to a new account."
---

<Warning>
If a wallet has been compromised, immediately transfer the member's allocation to a new account wallet in Spring.
</Warning>

See [How to manage investors inside a deal](/en/articles/7007612-how-to-manage-investors-inside-a-deal) for instructions.

## Key Point

Moving the allocations to a new account is the only way to make sure the hacker doesn't have access to modify sensitive data.

A hacker who has obtained access to an investor's wallet can sign into the investor's portal using their account and manipulate sensitive data.

## Important Note

Simply modifying receiving wallets is insufficient. Hackers can retain login access and potentially alter receiving wallets for open deals where the investor has contributed funds.

## Action for Affected Members

Members with compromised wallets should let your platform's administrator know immediately to get help modifying the account to which your allocations are linked.
