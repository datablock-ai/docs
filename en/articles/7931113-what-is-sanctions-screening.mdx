## Definition

Sanction screening is a process used to check individuals, organizations, or entities against official sanction lists.

Governments and international bodies maintain these lists to identify and restrict dealings with parties involved in prohibited activities, including terrorism, human rights abuses, or nuclear proliferation.

## Spring's Implementation

Spring incorporates automatic sanctions and watchlist screening into its Know Your Customer (KYC) process for investors. The screening checks against UN, EU, US, and UK sanctions lists and other blacklists and exclusions lists.

The system evaluates investor names, countries, and other identifying information against sanctioned parties databases. If an investor or associated wallet matches a sanctioned entity, the platform notifies the user and prevents the investment from proceeding.
