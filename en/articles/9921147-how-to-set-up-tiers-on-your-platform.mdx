## What are tiers?

Tiers allow you to set customized rules and control access and are a way to organize members into different levels.

## You can set up tiers based on

- **Tokens:** Establish tier structures for token holders or stakers
- **NFTs:** Create tier levels based on NFT ownership
- **User-Based:** Organize tiers according to your platform members

<Note>
When a token or NFT is being tracked, we scan for all holders and match them with verified Spring users, storing their balances. These scans are done daily, but you can also sync them whenever you choose.
</Note>

Once a token address is tracked, you can create Tiers inside your platform and determine the different functionality.

## You can gate access to

### Your platform
Restrict entrance based on specific tiers. For example, investors must hold a certain token or stake to gain access. If the token is sold or unstaked, the investor's access will be automatically revoked.

### Deals
Control deal access through tier-based pools with customizable restrictions.
