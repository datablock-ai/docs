## Fee Calculation Model

Spring uses a **deductive fee structure** for deal participation. Rather than adding fees on top of investments, they are subtracted from the investor's total contribution amount.

The formula is: **Invested amount - Fee = Allocation**

This allocation determines token distribution to investors.

## Example Walkthrough

With a 10% fee and $1 token price:

- Investor contributes: **$1,000**
- Fee calculation: 10% × $1,000 = **$100**
- Allocation: $1,000 - $100 = **$900**
- Tokens received: $900 ÷ $1 = **900 tokens**

The defining factor for the number of tokens an investor receives is the allocation.

## Fee Distribution

Fundraising fees and contributions are directed to the same **Fundraising Wallet** configured within each deal. Spring provides detailed tracking showing:
- Total amount raised toward SAFT
- Total fees charged

This enables managers to determine how much to send to the project per SAFT requirements.
