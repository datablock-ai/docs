## Why is my KYC "Failed" or "Declined"?

Your verification can be unsuccessful if you haven't completed the ID verification correctly or sufficiently.

See [How to complete the KYC process](/en/articles/7965786-how-to-complete-the-kyc-process) for instructions on proper completion.

## I completed my ID verification, but my KYC was rejected. Why?
