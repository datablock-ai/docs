An account wallet serves as the wallet address used to log in to Spring's platform and connects directly to the investor's contribution wallet.

## Key Points

### Allocation Assignment
- Allocations display in the investor portal based on the account wallet used for contributions
- Investors may select different wallets for token receipt, but the allocation will still belong to the investor portal of the account wallet

### Single Wallet Recommendation
- Every time an investor connects and contributes through a new wallet, a distinct account is established
- Platform recommends restricting contributions to one wallet per account

### Multiple Account Consequences
- Contributions across multiple accounts result in allocations spread across separate investor portals
- Platform administrators can consolidate allocations

<Warning>
If a wallet is compromised, it is imperative that you move all the investor's allocations to a new account wallet. Until moved, allocations remain at risk.
