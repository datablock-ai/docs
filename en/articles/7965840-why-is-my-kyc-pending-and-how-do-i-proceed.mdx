## Overview

When your Know Your Customer verification remains in a pending state, there are two primary causes: either your identity verification is incomplete or inaccurate, or the team requires supplementary information.

## Completing ID Verification Correctly

To properly complete the identity verification process, follow the detailed instructions in [How to complete the KYC process](/en/articles/7965786-how-to-complete-the-kyc-process).

## Receiving Notification of Additional Information Needs

The system communicates additional information requirements through email notifications. If no communication has been received, this indicates you must return and ensure the identity verification was completed accurately per the previous section.

## Accelerating the Review Process

<Tip>
Prompt email monitoring and providing accurate information during responses reduces back-and-forth communication delays, thereby expediting the overall verification timeline.
