## Overview

Spring enables users to import all historical deals and investment rounds into the platform. This feature is particularly valuable for organizations managing multiple fundraising activities in a centralized location.

## When to Use the Importer

The import functionality proves especially useful when:

- You possess numerous deals or investment rounds completed before adopting Spring and want centralized raise management
- You need to reflect allocations in allocation management for stakeholders who haven't contributed on-chain (FIAT investors, team members, advisors with token vesting)
- You want to enable OTC trading for previously completed deals or rounds
- You need to distribute tokens and manage vesting schedules across multiple deals in one system
- You want to provide investors with a unified view of all their deals through Spring's investor portal

## Supported File Formats

Spring accepts the following spreadsheet formats:
- Excel / Spreadsheets
- CSV
- .tsv (tab-separated values)

The platform employs an automated importer that scans and extracts data from specified fields.

## Required Data Fields

**Essential information:**
- Investor wallet address
- Fee percentage (use 0 if no fee applies)

**Plus at least one of:**
- Invested amount or allocation (before fee)
- Invested amount or allocation (after fee)

## Import Process

Users prepare deal/round data in spreadsheet format. Spring reviews the data format, provides feedback, and initiates the import once both parties confirm clarity.

## Import Volume

There is no limit on the number of deals importable. Average clients typically import 10-20 deals, though some have successfully imported over 200.

## Timeline

Import completion typically requires **24-48 hours** and depends on:
- Data cleaning requirements (clarity on fees, wallet addresses)
- Total number of deals being imported
