## Step-by-step process

1. **Navigate to Distributions**
   - Set up vesting schedule by clicking "Create schedule" (editable later via "Edit schedule")

2. **Click Prepare distribution**
   - Select the network and token for distribution

3. **Select Generate a breakdown**
   - System automatically updates token distribution amounts for all investors
   - Switch to desired wallet in browser; ensure correct chain connection

4. **Click Distribute now**

5. **Select Proceed to payment and click Pay**

6. **Complete on-chain transaction**
   - Distribute tokens in batch to entire cap table in one transaction using Spring's smart contract (multi-send)

## Post-distribution

The vesting progress automatically updates, and investors receive distribution emails. Bot notifications can be configured for Telegram and Discord. Repeat steps for subsequent distributions.
