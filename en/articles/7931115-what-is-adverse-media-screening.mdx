## Definition

Adverse media screening involves investigating public sources such as the media and the internet to determine if an individual or entity has been mentioned for engaging in illegal activities or negative behaviors.

This is an investigative component of the Know Your Customer (KYC) framework.

<Note>
While having a 'clean record' does not guarantee a person's integrity, conducting adverse media screening helps uncover potential red flags that should have been identified.
