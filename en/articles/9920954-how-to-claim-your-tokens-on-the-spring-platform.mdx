Spring enables token claiming specifically on the Ethereum blockchain. When your platform manager selects claiming as the distribution approach, you can access your Portfolio within the platform, pick the relevant deal, and complete the token claiming process.

<Tip>
You don't need to claim tokens after each distribution, you can accumulate multiple distributions and claim them all at once whenever you choose.
