All wallet addresses that interact with the Spring platform undergo screening against OFAC crypto-specific sanctions to prevent engagement with individuals or organizations linked to illegal activities.

Spring performs additional on-chain examinations of wallets and transactions for investors flagged as high-risk. This process involves tracing the origin and flow of funds and comparing them against risk categories to determine exclusion eligibility.

## Risk Areas Covered

The screening covers several risk areas:
- Sanctions exposure
- Money laundering and financial crime
- Links to terrorism and terrorist organizations
- Other illegal or illicit activities and content
