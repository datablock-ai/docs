## How to Add Verified Wallets

### 1. Access the Wallet Verification Settings

- Navigate to **Settings** in your Spring account
- Click on **Manage Verified Wallets**

### 2. Add a New Wallet for Verification

- Click **Verify New Wallet**
- If currently connected with your account wallet, **disconnect it**
- Connect with the **wallet that holds the required tokens or NFTs**

### 3. Verify Wallet Ownership

- Connect your wallet using **MetaMask** or another supported wallet
- Sign and approve the verification request to confirm ownership
- Once verified, Spring will scan your wallet for relevant tokens and NFTs

### 4. Viewing Verified Wallets

- After verification, log into your account wallet again and go to **Settings**
- Your login account wallet will be listed alongside additional verified wallets
- The system will automatically check the balance of all verified wallets to determine eligibility for upcoming deals

## Benefits of Verifying Wallets

- **Security:** Keep your tokens or NFTs in separate wallets while still meeting eligibility requirements
- **Flexibility:** Use multiple wallets without transferring assets to your account wallet
- **Automatic Eligibility:** The system fetches balances from verified wallets to determine if you qualify for deals
