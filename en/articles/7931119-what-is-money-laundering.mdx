## Definition

Money laundering is the process of making illegally obtained funds appear legal or legitimate.

## Sources of Illegal Funds

Examples include:
- Proceeds from drug trafficking
- Human trafficking and organized crime activities
- Bribery and corruption
- Fraud schemes
- Tax evasion

## How Money Laundering Works

Money laundering involves disguising the true source of funds to make them seem like they came from legitimate sources. Criminals accomplish this through creating complex transactions to obscure the money's origin.

## Prevention Guidance for Investment Groups

Consider these critical questions:

1. Do I know the source of funds for each investor?
2. Have I received documentation or proof to verify the source of funds?
3. Is the fund owner in a position to have legally obtained the funds?

<Warning>
Answering "no" to these questions represents a red flag.
