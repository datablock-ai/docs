## EVM wallets

Spring supports all EVM wallet providers. The platform continues to expand wallet extension compatibility, and users unable to locate their preferred wallet in the "WalletConnect" option can contact support for additional setup.

The most frequently utilized wallet providers include:
- Metamask
- Ronin
- Phantom

For alternative wallet providers, users should select the "WalletConnect" option and choose their preferred provider from the available menu.
