AML stands for Anti-Money Laundering. It refers to laws, regulations, and practices aimed at preventing the illegal process of disguising the origins of illicitly obtained money.

For businesses that are subject to such laws, AML involves implementing measures to detect and deter money laundering activities, such as terrorism financing, drug trafficking, or fraud.

<Warning>
Without robust AML systems in place, your business can risk becoming an unwitting participant in criminal activities.
