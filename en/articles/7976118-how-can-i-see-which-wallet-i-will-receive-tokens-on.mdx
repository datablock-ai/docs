When contributing to a deal, the wallet you will receive tokens on is the wallet you have contributed from, unless you specify a different EVM or Non-EVM wallet when contributing.

## Instructions for Finding Wallet Information

### For specific deal wallets

Navigate to your investor portal's Portfolio tab, select the relevant Project, then access the "Wallets & answers" tab to view receiving wallet details.

### For claimable tokens

Claimable tokens are always sent to your account wallet. Users can log into the Portfolio tab with their account wallet and claim tokens directly from the specific project.
